            <p>Why not try earning some MM by doing math problems? Math problems come in 5 different difficulties: sixlet only (25 MM per problem), easy (100 MM per problem), moderate (250 MM per problem), hard (1000 MM per problem), and Terence Tao (2500 MM per problem).</p>
            <p>The problems are listed below.</p>
            <p>Sixlet only: Find the largest prime number less than 1,000,000 and find the smallest prime number more than 1,000,000. Calculator allowed. Programming allowed. Internet not allowed.</p>
            <p>Easy: Michael Luoser blindly flips 4 coins, 2 of them red, 1 of them blue, and 1 of them having a 50 percent chance of being red and a 50 percent chance of being blue. Red coins have a 75 percent chance of coming up heads. Blue coins have a 50 percent chance of coming up heads. What is the expected number of heads? Calculator allowed. Programming allowed. Internet not allowed.</p>
            <p>Moderate: In a fictional 2-dimensional universe, Michael Gamer says "amogus" too many times. His crewmates eject him from the spaceship. The spaceship is at (0,0) on the coordinate plane, and heading towards the point (infinity, 0) at a speed of 1 unit per year. Unfortunately, the instruments used to measure the heading and speed of the ship are not very accurate. Therefore, the spaceship's movement could be slightly angled, so the vector of the spaceship's movement could have a slope of anywhere from -0.05 to 0.05. Likewise, the speed of the ship could be anywhere from 0.95 units per year or 1.05 units per year. An infinite amount of years later, when Michael Gamer has reached his final resting point, spaceships search for Michael Gamer's dead body. In square units, what is the area that the spaceships have to search? Calculator allowed. Programming allowed. Internet not allowed.</p>
            <p>Hard: Calculate the side lengths of 2 triangles ABC and DEF such that the perimeter of ABC is twice that of DEF, the area of ABC is half that of DEF, and the side lengths of the two triangles are all integers. Calculator allowed. Programming allowed. Internet allowed.</p>
            <p>Terence Tao: Michael Gamer flips 16 fair coins and randomly arranges them into a 4x4 grid of coins. An arrangement is "continental" if and only if: a) there is more than 1 head out of the 16 coins, and b) there is a path from every coin flipped heads to every other flipped heads by only moving up, down, left, right through other coins flipped heads, or every coin flipped heads is connected. (Diagonal doesn't count.) What is the probability a random arrangement of coins is continental? Calculator allowed. Programming allowed. Internet allowed.</p>
